Our team has decided to implement one extra funcionality. When somenone win a tournament the app is going to give a prize to the winner user in the form of diploma. This diploma is going to generate a PDF that permits winners to download, keep and print it. 

### ALGORITHM USED
The developing team is going to create an algorithm which automatically generates a ranking taking into account the player points and victories, even the category's player that is taking part for. The ranking is going to display in one of the screens we have created and the rest of users can see all the results and stadistics the top players have. The ranking is going to be updated everyday and will show all the changes which have been produced.
